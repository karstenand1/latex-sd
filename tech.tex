\chapter{Technologies Used}

Framework:

\begin{itemize}
\item Swift - Swift is the most modern language used for producing native iOS apps.  It is more readable and flexible than Obj-C, making it a better choice for this project. It is also backwards compatible with Obj-C and C++ libraries so it does not limit the usage of open source material in the system. It is used for the framework as well as the trilateration calculations.
\end{itemize}

Admin Webservice:

\begin{itemize}
\item HTML/CSS - Will be used for formatting and styling of admin webpage.
\item Javascript and JQuery - Javascript was used to add responsiveness and to provide underlying front end logic. JQuery was used to simplify DOM manipulation of admin webpage and AJAX calls.
\item PHP - Used on the back end of the admin web service to sanitize inputs and interface with the database.
\item MySQL - Used for the datastore of the admin web service.
\item Google Maps API - Used for abstract mapping of floor plan to real life latitude and longitude.
\end{itemize}

Network:
\begin{itemize}
\item iBeacon - the iBeacon protocol will be used in all broadcasting beacons
\end{itemize}
