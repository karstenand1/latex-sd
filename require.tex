\chapter{Requirements}

\section{Functional Requirements}
Below are the initial requirements that were decided when the project was proposed.
\newline

Critical:
\begin{itemize}
\item The system will return a location when 3+ beacons are available
\item The system will be able to interpret BLE beacon noise levels to produce a precise location
\item The system will give more accurate location data than GPS or WiFi in specific situations
\end{itemize}
Recommended:
\begin{itemize}
\item Offline installation of system does not undermine its usability for devs and admins
\end{itemize}

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}

Critical:
\begin{itemize}
\item The framework is easy to use for developers
\item The framework will return location coordinates with an security between 0m and 5m
\item The system will scale to large applications
\end{itemize}
Recommended:
\begin{itemize}
\item Admin interface is easy to use
\item Framework is optimized for battery conservations
\end{itemize}

\section{Design Constraints}

\begin{itemize}
\item System must work on iOS
\item Must use low cost BLE beacons
\item System conforms to iBeacon protocol
\end{itemize}
