\section{Summary}

People who are interested in understanding where they currently are in relationship to other people or landmarks and do
not have access to GPS or Wifi are not able to get accurate location information. In many cases, GPS and WiFi fail to provide the
accuracy required to provide useful information as well.
\newline \par
Our solution is a software layer that utilizes existing bluetooth
hardware to create an accurate relative positioning system. The software layer utilized a variety of algorithms to interpret the
relative signal strength of known bluetooth transmitters and try to return a useful, three dimensional, representation of
where an iOS device is. The framework offered a software solution that is cheap and
highly distributable due to the fact that it utilizes existing technologies.
