Currently, there is no way to accurately track a mobile deviceâ€™s position in a given space without the use of GPS or WiFi.
This means that people who are interested in understanding where they currently are in relationship to other people or landmarks and do
not have access to these technologies are not able to get accurate location information. In many cases, GPS and WiFi fail to provide the
accuracy required to provide useful information.
\par
The solution being proposed is a software layer that utilizes existing bluetooth
hardware to create a highly accurate relative positioning system. The software layer will utilize a variety of algorithms to interpret the
relative signal strength of known bluetooth transmitters and will be able to return a useful, three dimensional, representation of
where a smartphone or other bluetooth device is. The proposed framework offers a software solution that will be cheap and
highly distributable due to the fact that is utilizes existing technologies.
